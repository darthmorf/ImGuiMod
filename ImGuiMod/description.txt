ImGUI

A mod that allows you to use the graphical interface of Dear ImGui in terraria.

For players:
This mod is a library so if you are a player just don't download it as you won't get any new content or functionality.

For modders:
If you want to use the library then you should do the following:

Add this line to build.txt:
 modReferences = ImGUI

Extract this mod to get the reference dlls, go to your IDE and add the reference files:
 ImGUI.dll and lib/ImGuiNET.dll

Finally, create a class that inherits from ModImGui and override the methods to start using ImGui.** calls

Override DebugGUI to create elements in a window shared with all other ModImGui, override CustomGUI to create your own windows.

Extra notes:
The goal of this mod is to help you have a very easy way to view information while developing instead of being a way to create GUIs for normal mods.
